# Binder environment

This folder contains the configurations and the notebooks so that
[repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker) can turn this
repository into a Dockerized demo environment. This can serve for instance to
have a publicly hosted demonstrator of VAST on
[mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).
