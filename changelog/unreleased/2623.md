VAST has a new configuration setting, `vast.zstd-compression-level`, to control
the compression level of the Zstd algorithm used in both the Feather and
Parquet store backend. The default value is taken from Apache Arrow, which
changes the default for Parquet, which previously had its own default of `9`.
