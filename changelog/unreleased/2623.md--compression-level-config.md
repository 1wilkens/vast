There is a new setting, `vast.zstd-compression-level`, to control the
compression level of the zstd algorithm used in both the feather and parquet
store backend. The default value is `1`, which already was the default for the
feather store backend, but is a change for parquet, which previously had its
own default of `9`. We find `1` to be a very good trade-off between performance
and storage size.
