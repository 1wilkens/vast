VAST is now distributed as a Debian Package. The package for this release can be
obtained from
[https://storage.googleapis.com/tenzir-public-data/vast-static-builds/vast_v2.4.0_amd64.deb].
This package automatically installs a systemd service and creates a `vast` user
for the database process, greatly simplifying the setup process. Refer to [the
docs](https://vast.io/docs/setup-vast/install/linux#debian) for detailed
instructions.
