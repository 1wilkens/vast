VAST is now distributed as a Debian Package. It is attached to each [release on
GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/vast/releases). This package automatically
installs a systemd service and creates a `vast` user for the database process,
greatly simplifying the setup process. Refer to [the
docs](https://vast.io/docs/setup/install/linux#debian) for detailed
instructions.
