## Summarization Improvements

We've improved the behavior of the [`summarize`][summarize] operator. It is now
possible to specify an explicit name for the output fields. This is helpful when
the downstream processing needs a predictable schema. Previously, VAST took
simply the name of the input field. The syntax was as follows:

```yaml
summarize:
  group-by:
    - ...
  aggregate:
    min:
      - ts # implied name for aggregate field
```

We now switched the syntax such that the new field name is at the beginning:

```yaml
summarize:
  group-by:
    - ...
  aggregate:
    ts_min: # explicit name for aggregate field
      min: ts
```

In SQL, this would be the `AS` token: `SELECT min(ts) AS min_ts`.
