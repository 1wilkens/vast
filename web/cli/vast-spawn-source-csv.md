The `spawn source csv` command spawns a CSV source inside the node and is the
analog to the `import csv` command.

For more information, please refer to the documentation for the commands [`spawn
source`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/spawn/source) and [`import
csv`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/import#import-csv).
