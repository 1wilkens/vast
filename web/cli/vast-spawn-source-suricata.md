The `spawn source suricata` command spawns a Suricata source inside the node and
is the analog to the `import suricata` command.

For more information, please refer to the documentation for the [`spawn
source`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/spawn/source) and [`import
suricata`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/import#import-suricata).
