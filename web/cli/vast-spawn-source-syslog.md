The `spawn source syslog` command spawns a Syslog source inside the node and is
the analog to the `import syslog` command.

For more information, please refer to the documentation for the commands [`spawn
source`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/spawn/source) and [`import
syslog`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/import#import-syslog).
