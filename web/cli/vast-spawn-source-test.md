The `spawn source test` command spawns a test source inside the node and is the
analog to the `import test` command.

For more information, please refer to the documentation for the commands [`spawn
source`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/spawn/source) and [`import
test`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/import#import-test).
