The `spawn source zeek` command spawns a Zeek source inside the node and is the
analog to the `import zeek` command.

For more information, please refer to the documentation for the commands [`spawn
source`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/spawn/source) and [`import
zeek`](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/import#import-zeek).
