The `spawn source` command spawns a new source inside the node.

The following commands do the same thing, except for the `spawn source` version
not running in a separate process:

```bash
vast spawn source [options] <format> [options] [expr]
vast import [options] <format> [options] [expr]
```

For more information, please refer to the [documentation for the `import`
command](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/cli/vast/import).
