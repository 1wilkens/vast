# Contribution Workflow

This section explains how to contribute to the VAST project. As an open-source
project with the aim to build a community, we encourage contributions of any
kind: new code, documentation enhancements, feature requests, suggestions for
improvements, or simply just feedback. We strive to make our development
as transparent as possible. If you have any questions about the process, please
do not hesitate to reach out to us in [Community Slack](http://slack.tenzir.com)
or by opening a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/tenzir/vast/discussions).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
