# Build

Like many C++ projects, VAST uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) to manage the build
process. Aside from a modern C++20 compiler, you need to ensure availability of
the dependencies in the table below.

We provide [Nix](#nix) expressions for deterministic builds.

## Dependencies

:::tip SPDX SBOM
Every [release](https://github.com/tenzir/vast/releases) of VAST includes an
[SBOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bill_of_materials) in
[SPDX](https://spdx.dev) format that includes a comprehensive listing of all
dependencies and versions.

The minimum specified versions reflect those versions that we use in CI and
manual testing. Older versions may still work in select cases.

### Nix Environment

We provide a Nix flake you can use to setup an environment in which all
dependencies are available. Running `nix develop` inside the main source
directory will get you there.

You can also delegate the entire build process to Nix with by invoking
`nix build`, but be aware that this method does not support incremental
builds in case you plan to make changes to the source code.

## Compile

Building VAST involves the following steps:

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/tenzir/vast/releases/latest)
   or clone the repository recursively:
  ```bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/tenzir/vast
  ```

2. Configure the build with CMake. For faster builds, we recommend passing
  `-G Ninja` to `cmake`.
  ```bash
  cd vast
  cmake -B build
  ```

  Optionally, you can use the CMake TUI to visually configure the build:
  ```bash
  ccmake build
  ```

  The source tree also contains a set of CMake presets that combine various
  configuration options into curated build flavors. You can list them with:
  ```bash
  cmake --list-presets
  ```

3. Build the executable:
  ```bash
  cmake --build build --target all
  ```

## Test

After you have built the executable, run the unit and integration tests to
verify that your build works as expected:

1. Run component-level unit tests:
  ```bash
  ctest --test-dir build
  ```

2. Run end-to-end integration tests:
  ```bash
  cmake --build build --target integration
  ```
## Install

5. Install VAST system-wide or into a custom prefix:
  ```bash
  cmake --install build
  # Optional: Install to a custom prefix
  cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/install/prefix
  ```
