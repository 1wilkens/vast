# Deploy

Deployment to us means taking a packaged artifact, like an image, and spinning
it up in a runtime.

We currently support the following runtimes:
1. [AWS](deploy/aws)
2. [Docker](deploy/docker)

We also provide an Ansible role for bare-metal and traditional virtual machines
in the [ansible directory](/ansible).
