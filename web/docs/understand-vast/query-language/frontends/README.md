A query language *frontend* is the representation of query. VAST features a
[query language plugin][query-language-plugin] that allows for exchanging the
query frontend by replacing it with a different language.

The [**VAST** **Q**uery **L**anguage (VASTQL)](.) is the default query language
frontend. Besides VAST, the following frontends ship with VAST:
