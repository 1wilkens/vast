# Query Language

The **VAST** **Q**uery **L**anguage (VASTQL) is a language for searching over
richly typed structured data.

The language is currently limited to the [expression
language](query-language/expressions) to flexibly filter a subset of data, but
will soon include [pipelines](query-language/pipelines) for transformations and
analytics.
